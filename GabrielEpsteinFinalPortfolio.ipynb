I am curious to see if covid 19 caused any interesting changes in drug overdose deaths, either by location (state), ethnicity, age, or any other factor. For this first milestone, I will be looking at data from my home state of Connecticut. This data is available in the above listed \"Accidental Drug Death Dataset,\" and is derived from an investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. It includes the toxicity report, the death certificate, and a bit of scene investigation results as well. which includes the toxicity report, death certificate, as well as a scene investigation. \n","\n","In the upcoming future, I'd like to look at if changes in personal economic trends have any relevance to drug overdose deaths. I'd also like to see if there is a disproportionately affected group of people, whether by sexual orientation, race, age, etc.\n","\n","Some of the relevant datasets are included above."],"metadata":{"id":"52NgVfWOeghy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Collaboration Plan\n","\n","I will be doing this project on my own, so there is not much of a collaboration plan."],"metadata":{"id":"_n2Jwr6qzCD3"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Let's Jump In!**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5hIoONqk0PeQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Importing Libraries:** Below, I am importing some of the libraries I will be using to analyze this data.

Discussion:** Off the bat, it seems that there are more deaths between 30-40 year olds than other age groups. It also seems to me that men are more frequently overdosing than women. While this is only preliminary, and there is much more that could be done (which I plan to do), this feels like a good start. After some more cleanup (things like removing NaN's and reorganizing the dataframe to be more easily used in certain instances), I'd like to look at things like whether or not men or women were more affected throughout the pandemic by drug overdose deaths, if things like income, race, or age come into play, and if locations differed significantly in how they were affected by drug overdose deaths throughout covid! I think I will plot male vs female deaths by age next. "],"metadata":{"id":"G-BmoyMUi1vA"}}]}
